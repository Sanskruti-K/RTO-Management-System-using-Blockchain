# Description
We proposed a system in which the work of traffic police and driver (user) is simplified. In this system the driver will register to RTO services and the login credentials will be provided to driver to login. The driver will upload document details like RTO driving license etc therefore it is not necessary to him to carry 
hard copy driving license wit him and also user can raise a complaint against the police. At RTO traffic police end the police will open the application and enter the vehical number and the data from server will be fetched and documents details like Emission , Insurance etc, for verification will be shown.
Designing the web application in such a way that all the vehicle document details will be available on one click by entering the vehicle number, due to this the traffic can be avoided as much as possible, and the user or driver can raise the complaints  and also the user or driver can pay the fine using this application securely. We proposed how blockchain technology is used in vehicle registration process and how it maintain its data and activities in a more secured, reliable and efficient mode.
